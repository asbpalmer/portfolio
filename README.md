# Hello! I'm Autumn Palmer
I've been working with Artificial Intelligence for as long as I've been coding. 

My first foray into the field was self-researched and implemented neural network that took a chemical's formula and tried to predict it's properties. My experience and education in the field has exploded with time as I've tried to iteratively improve my understanding the whole family of automated learning algorithms.

Here, you can find my projects, contributions, and musings as I try to better my knowledge in a myriad of different scopes of cutting-edge algorithms. I'll include a README at the top of each project to highlight some of my key takeaways from the project, how I would aim to do better in future projects, and anywhere that I want to take the experience.

### Big Data Projects
Here, you can see my experience with a variety of Big Data approaches including Apache Spark (through PySpark), AWS (DynamoDB), pandas, and MongoDB.

Big Data and large-scale algorithms are absolutely crucial to the field of machine learning (and data science in general), so I was incredibly fortunate to be able to take a very hands-on, industry-driven class on the subject that gave me the exposure and experience in the best-in-breed techniques. I keep these projects in mind for all things data because I know just how important quick and accurate data manipulation can make the difference for machine learning.

**BigDataBrooklynHousing**
- Demonstrates my initial approaches to data exploratoin using Pandas
- Cleans the data and extracts the most relevant members of the datset
- Draws connections and conclusions based on several variables

**BigDataSparkRDDMovies**
- Demonstrates data manipulation through PySpark RDDs
- Shows efficient function declaration to process data through maps
- Illustrates key aspects of the dataset

**BigDataSparkDFFireData**
- Demonstrates data processing thorugh PySpark DataFrames
- Cleans the data into useful typings for future storage and manipulation through a variety of techniques
- Manipulates multiple formats of data (CSV, NoSQL API Data) to perform data analysis

**BigDataAWSNoSQLHurricaneData and BigDataMongoDBHurricaneData**
- Demonstrate the usage of NoSQL techniques to scrape, filter through, and process raw data
- Implement robust algorithms to handle edge cases that naturally arrive from API data
- Use multiple technologies (DynamoDB and MongoDB) to achieve the same task

### Machine Learning and 
I have a strong background in machine learning (I guided myself to make a neural network 5 years ago) and mathematics in general. I've worked hard to get an intuition for the driving algorithms behind a wide foray of mathematical processes from the numercial analysis of real-world systems to the complex working of neural networks, and I am eager to demonstrate how I've implemented some of these algorithms in my own projects.

**RobotArm**
- Manages a complicated system using special-made objects to create a self-guiding robot arm
- Implements gradient descent and inverse kinematics algorithms with a complicated loss function to avoid end-effector collisions
- Shows a strong mathematical understanding of the underlying principles of automated learning

### Other Programming Projects
The following projects are mostly ones that I am proud of but don't have machine learning as a massive focus of theirs (though I do love to throw in a little ML flair where I think it may benefit an algorithm). That said, they really highlight my abilities as a programmer to tackle complicated projects with panache.
