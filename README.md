# Hello! I'm Autumn Palmer
I've been working with Artificial Intelligence for as long as I've been coding. 

My first foray into the field was self-researched and implemented neural network that took a chemical's formula and tried to predict it's properties. My experience and education in the field has exploded with time as I've tried to iteratively improve my understanding the whole family of automated learning algorithms.

Here, you can find my projects, contributions, and musings as I try to better my knowledge in a myriad of different scopes of cutting-edge algorithms. I'll include a README at the top of each project to highlight some of my key takeaways from the project, how I would aim to do better in future projects, and anywhere that I want to take the experience.
